            <p>Hi &#x1F920;</p>
            <p>My name is <b>Noah</b> and I'm from Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>I'm 20 years old and a junior studying Business Analytics (BUAN) at Lehigh University &#x1F985;</p>
            <p>During my free time I like to <span id="typing-content"></span></p>

            <h1 class="left-aligned"> About Me &#x1F468;</h1>
            <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p>I love learning new things. My curiosity expands into every aspect of my life. My dream is to be a
                    venture capitalist, and a leading voice in media and tech. I fell into coding in college after
                    wanting to web scrape and automate daily processes. Eventually, I realized that I can utilize these
                    skills to make my hobbies more enjoyable such as researching stock and analyzing NBA statistics.
                </p>
                <p>Currently, I'm interest in a wide variety of fields. While data visualization is my specialty, I
                    don't want to limit myself to those roles. My ideal workplace is dynamic where I can work with many
                    different sectors of the business, and learn as much as I can. I believe I can have high impact with
                    identifying inefficiencies/pain points and formulating process improvement strategies</p>
